When you use a heavy graphics mod in your GTA V, the game may crash, even with game config. But what is the reason?  When you run a heavy graphics mod, even the game config may not be able to handle it and cause a crash. So you need a healthy and strong anti-crash. <b>Fox Crash</b> is a very light and powerful anti-crash that solves problems with predefined commands. In fact, this anti-crash only works with your Windows registry and does not change any files. This anti-crash deletes the cache and extra files of DirectX so that the wrong game does not read it, and even deletes the registry files of old programs such as Internet Explorer to avoid multiple lags and crashes. Fox Crash has nothing to do with your game files and you can run this anti-crash in GTA Online and FiveM.

<b>Prerequisite:</b>
<p></p>
<b>Game Config</b> (It is not mandatory, but it is recommended for better anti-crash performance)
<p></p>
<b>Important points:</b>
<p><b>•</b>To run this anti-crash, your game version must be 1.60 and above (it is recommended to use the latest version of the game - this may change in future updates)</p>
<p><b>•</b>Fox Crash is fully optimized and does not cause frame drops.</p>
<p><b>•</b>Fox Crash updates every new build from GTA V. It is recommended to keep your anti-crash updated because bugs are fixed and more graphic mods are compatible.</p>
<p><b>•</b>If you have any problems, get help from Core-Load plugin or report to us.</p>
